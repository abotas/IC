## FEE CALIBRATION STUFF ##

The hdf5 files databases measured at IFIC (16/9/2016) are stored
in dateuser@daqdell01.ific.uv.es. They have not been added to GitHub Repo
for disk space reasons (over 350 MB compressed)

The FEE_CALIBRATION.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook - forgive me it's my first JPN :-)
carries the calibration process. Please read all the notes and contact me if
you need any help. Remmember that 50u and 100u pulses have been excluded from
calibration

find_coeff_II is used by FEE_CALIBRATION. It is still based on old DBLR_cal since
it only applies the basic algorithm BLRc

  +++ CRITICAL CHANGES +++


PMT base interaction with Coupling Capacitor has been detected. The evaluation of this 
effect shows a potential severe effect on energy estimation for long pulses (over 100u)
which might introduce 1% error.
The whole FEE model has been refined in order to include this effect and a solution
has been proposed which allows to measure energy with a maximum error of 0.072% (WC)
The fix is based on a software implemented filter which processes the FEE output before BLR deconvolution
operation. This filter cleans the "ghost" image of the input pulse which is injected at the FEE output by the
PMT base interaction.
