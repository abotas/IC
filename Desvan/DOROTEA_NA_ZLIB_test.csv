# Configuration file for DOROTEA
# The parameters for DOROTEA are:
#
#        PATH_IN = path to input DST file (must be a MCRD file)
#        FILE_IN = name of input DST file
#
#        FIRST_EVT,LAST_EVT,RUN_ALL
#
#        RUN_ALL is used to decide whether to run all the events in the file
#        in case that the total number of events requested (LAST_EVT-FIRST_EVT) 
#        exceeds the number of events in the DST file. If RUN_ALL is set to 1 (True), 
#        the script will run over all elements in the DST, 
#        otherwise it will exit with a warning.
