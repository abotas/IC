This comes at the cost of loosing reflection/introspection. pyROOT objects can only be manipulated using their C++ interfaces, which are often not obviously translated to python (maps is a good example). \n",

The TWF1ns are the input to the Simulation of the Energy Plane Response (SIERPE), which convolutes the TWF1ns with the response of the Energy plane FEE and outputs waveforms in bins of 25 ns (in adc counts), corresponding to those that are produced by the DAQ if no Baseline Restoration is performed in the FPGA. Those waveforms are called Raw Waveforms (RWF). RWF show the negative swing introduced by the FEE and need to be corrected by digital base line restoration (DBLR). \n",
