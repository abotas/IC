    "1. Since the GATE objects were designed in C++, the objects exposed to python are \"C++ translations\" performed by pyROOT. This comes at the cost of loosing reflection/introspection. pyROOT objects can only be manipulated using their C++ interfaces, which are often not obviously translated to python (maps is a good example). \n",

    "1. For detailed studies of the Energy Plane FEE, waveforms (bins of 1 ns) in photoelectrons (pes) are neeed. We refer to these as Monte Carlo Raw Data (MCRD). The PMT MCRD is the input to the Simulation of the Energy Plane Response (SIERPE), which convolutes the MCRD with the response of the Energy plane FEE and outputs True Waveforms, BLR Waveforms and Raw Waveforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are also MCRD for the SiPMs, in bins of 1 mus. The SiPM MCRD is the input to the simulation of the SiPM noise, which in turn creates RWF for the SiPMs (also binned in 1 mus).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PMT TWF are simply MCRD which are: a) Zero Supressed (ZS); b) binned at 1 mus (to save space and match PMT and SiPMs, eg., for PMAPS). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. PMT RWF are the output of the FEE + DAQ. They are obtained by convoluting the MCRD with the LPF and HPF characteristic of the Energy Plane FEE. They are also decimated by the DAQ. The output of the FEE + DAQ is in adc counts. \n",

    "5. PMT BLR are also output of the FEE + DAQ, but applying only the LPF, e.g, they correspond to the response of an electronics that would not distort the WF, or to the outuput of a perfectly resoted baseline (thus the Base Line Restored or BLR). \n",
    "\n",
    "6. We save TWF, RWF and BLR waveforms for the PMTs. In the Monte Carlo data, the three sets will allow detailed comparisons to quantify the effect of noise and peak-finding in the resolution (comparison TWF and BLR) and the effect of convolution/deconvolution (RWF are lated deconvolved using a BLR algorithm and produce corrected waveforms, CWF, which can be compared with BLR waveforms)\n",

    "8. In the data produced by the DAQ we will save BLR waveforms and RWF too. In the data BLR are PMT waveforms which have been corrected by BLR in the FPGA, while RWF are direct output from the DAQ. \n",

In spite of the fact that 1 ns waveforms are very large (thus MCRD files weight about 10 MB per event if not compressed), compression is very effective here, since most of the WF contents are zeros. The actual size of the event is of the order of 336 kb. \n",
