## FEE CALIBRATION STUFF ##

The hdf5 files databases measured at IFIC (16/9/2016) are stored
in dateuser@daqdell01.ific.uv.es. They have not been added to GitHub Repo
for disk space reasons (over 350 MB compressed)

The FEE_CALIBRATION.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook - forgive me it's my first JPN :-)
carries the calibration process. Please read all the notes and contact me if
you need any help. Remmember that 50u and 100u pulses have been excluded from
calibration

find_coeff_II is used by FEE_CALIBRATION. It is still based on old DBLR_cal since
it only applies the basic algorithm BLRc
