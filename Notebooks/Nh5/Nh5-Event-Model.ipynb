    "1. Since the GATE objects were designed in C++, the objects exposed to python are \"C++ translations\" performed by pyROOT. This comes at the cost of loosing reflection/introspection. pyROOT objects can only be manipulated using their C++ interfaces, which are often not obviously translated to python (maps is a good example). \n",

In spite of the fact that 1 ns waveforms are very large (thus MCRD files weight about 10 MB per event if not compressed), compression is very effective here, since most of the WF contents are zeros. The actual size of the event is of the order of 250 kb. \n",

    "Nexus + art produce WF in bins of 25 ns, while RWF, CWF and TWF are DECIMATED in bins of 25 ns from the original MCRD WF. The difference is relevant, in the sense that the DAQ produces also decimated WF. In practice is very simple to convert a decimated WF into a \"rebinned\" WF, simply: rebinned = decimated * 25. It is imoportant to carry the bookeeping right. The total energy of a decimated WF is sum(wF)x 25 (25 ns is the decimation factor), while the total energy of a rebinned WF is just the sum(wF). "
