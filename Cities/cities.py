diomira ="""
Leaving there and proceeding for three days toward the east, you reach Diomira, 
a city with sixty silver domes, bronze statues of all the gods, streets paved with lead, 
a crystal theater, a golden cock that crows every morning on a tower. 
All these beauties will already be familiar to the visitor, 
who has seen them also in other cities. 
But the special quality of this city for the man who arrives there on a September evening, 
when the days are growing shorter 
and the multicolored lamps are lighted all at once at the doors of the food stalls 
and from a terrace a woman's voice cries ooh!, is that he feels envy 
toward those who now believe they have once before lived an 
evening identical to this and who think they were happy, that time."""

isidora="""
When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a city. 
Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have spiral staircases 
encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect telescopes and violins are made, 
where the foreigner hesitating between two women always encounters a third, 
where cockfights degenerate into bloody brawls among the bettors. 
He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city. 
Isidora, therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one difference. 
The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age. 
In the square there is the wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; 
he is seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories.
