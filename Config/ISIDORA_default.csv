# Configuration file for ISIDORA
# The parameters for ISIDORA are:
#
#        PATH_IN = path to DST file
#        FILE_IN = name of DST file
#        FIRST_EVT,LAST_EVT,RUN_ALL,
#
#        RUN_ALL is used to decide whether to run all the events in the file
#        in case that the total number of events requested (LAST_EVT-FIRST_EVT) 
#        exceeds the number of events in the DST file. If RUN_ALL is set to 1 (True), 
#        the script will run over all elements in the DST, 
#        otherwise it will exit with a warning.
#
#        CA = Nominal (measured) values of the capacitors defining the filter
#        MAU_LEN = length of MAU
#        THR1, THR2, THR3, are trhesholds for the DBLR algorithm 
#        Threshold 1 is used to decide when raw signal raises up above trigger line
#        Threshold 2 is used to decide when reconstructed signal is above trigger line
#        Threshold 3 is used to compare Raw and Rec signal
#
