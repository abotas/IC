# Configuration file for DIOMIRA
# The parameters for DIOMIRA are:

# PATH_IN = path to input DST file (must be a MCRD file)
# PATH_OUT = path to output DST file (RWF file)
# FILE_IN = path to input DST file (must be a MCRD file)
# FILE_OUT = name of ouput DST file (RWF file)
# PATH_DB =  = path to the database directory
# FIRST_EVT,LAST_EVT,RUN_ALL,
#
# RUN_ALL is used to decide whether to run all the events in the file
# in case that the total number of events requested (LAST_EVT-FIRST_EVT)
# exceeds the number of events in the DST file. If RUN_ALL is set to 1 (True),
# the script will run over all elements in the DST,
# otherwise it will exit with a warning.
# COMPRESSION = compression library used (ZLIB for now)
# NOISE_CUT = noise cut level for SiPMs
