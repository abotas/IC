# Configuration file for DIOMIRA
# The parameters for DIOMIRA are:
#
#        PATH_IN = path to input DST file (must be a MCRD file)
#        FILE_IN = name of input DST file
#        PATH_OUT = path to output DST file (RWF file)
#        FILE_OUT = name of ouput DST file (RWF file)
#        PATH_DB  = path to the database directory
#        FIRST_EVT,LAST_EVT,RUN_ALL,
#        BLR = on, then create and save BLR WF, otherwise don't
#        RUN_ALL is used to decide whether to run all the events in the file
#        in case that the total number of events requested (LAST_EVT-FIRST_EVT)
#        exceeds the number of events in the DST file.
#         If RUN_ALL is set to 1 (True),
#        the script will run over all elements in the DST,
#        otherwise it will exit with a warning.
#        CLIB = compression library used: values can be 'ZLIB', 'BLOSC' or
#        'NONE'
#        CLEVEL = compression level
#        NOISE_CUT gives the value of the soft noise cunt in the SiPMs
